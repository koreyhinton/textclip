TEXTCLIP CHROME EXTENSION

The chrome extension can download selected text from a webpage into plain text
(Note: paragraph/line-breaks cannot be preserved) by right-clicking the
selction. The text will be word-bounded w/ 74 character limit to be ideal for
grep searching later. To install it, in Chrome go to: chrome://extensions and
enable Developer mode and select "Load unpacked extension" and choose the
chrome-extension folder.

TEXTCLIP BASH SCRIPT

Also included is a script to target clipped text in a targetted way. The way I
use it is to leave my textclip files in ~/Downloads where they were downloaded
and then after making the textclip script executable and adding to path I run
the textclip command with exact search expression to find what I'm looking for:

    textclip "pyenv"
